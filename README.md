# Metryx App

This project creates a Radar chart and data table, taken from static file which is saved as data.json.

## Technology used               

The application was developed using React framework along with react-bootstarp front-end framework the radar chart was lifted using react-chartjs-2 library, the data is passed as props to create table rows.

## Running the application 

Runing the code locally will need cloning the repo . you will have to npm install the following dependencies : "react-bootstrap", "react-chartjs-2", "react-table". when installed you can start the react app with the command "npm start".
 
### Further work if more time availbe 

Further work if more time available
The application could have a set of buttons to make it interactive by prompting the user to enter data in a form , and represent it by chart.
